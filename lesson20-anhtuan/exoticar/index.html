                    <h1>Sports Car</h1>
                    <h3>What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without being a sports car.</h3>
                    <p>A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile designed for
                        spirited performance and nimble handling. The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in
                        1919. According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in
                        1928. Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight are
                        requisite. Sports cars are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low
                        center of gravity compared to standard models. Steering and suspension are typically designed
                        for precise control at high speeds. Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed
                        coup√©s also started to become popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car
                        and a grand tourer is not absolute.

                    <h1>Seating Layout</h1>
                    <h3>Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.</h3>
                    <p>Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and early sporting regulations
                        often demanded four seats (even three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats
                        became common from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may also have small back seats that
                        are often really only suitable for luggage or small children; such a configuration is referred
                        to as a 2+2 (two full seats + two "occasional" seats).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the practicality of
                        their vehicles by increasing the seating room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the
                        center of the car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on each side and slightly behind
                        the driver. The arrangement was originally considered for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned
                        as impractical because of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. McLaren used
                        the design in their F1.
