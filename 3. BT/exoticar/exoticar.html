                    <p>What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without being a sports car.</p>
                    <p>A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile designed for
                        spirited
                        performance and nimble handling. The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919.
                        According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in 1928.
                        Sports
                        cars started to become popular during the 1920s.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight are
                        requisite.
                        Sports cars are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of
                        gravity
                        compared to standard models. Steering and suspension are typically designed for precise control
                        at
                        high speeds. Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coupés also started to
                        become
                        popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is not
                        absolute.

                    <p>Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.</p>
                    <p>Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and early sporting regulations
                        often
                        demanded four seats (even three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats became
                        common from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may also have small back seats that are
                        often
                        really only suitable for luggage or small children; such a configuration is referred to as a 2+2
                        (two full seats + two "occasional" seats).<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the practicality of
                        their
                        vehicles by increasing the seating room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the center
                        of
                        the car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on each side and slightly behind the
                        driver.
                        The arrangement was originally considered for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as
                        impractical
                        because of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. McLaren used the design in
                        their
                        F1.
