            What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without
            being a sports car.
          </p>

          <p class="article__content left__text--black">
            A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door
            automobile designed for spirited performance and nimble handling.
            The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919.
            According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use
            of the term was in 1928. Sports cars started to become popular
            during the 1920s.
          </p>

          <p class="article__content left__text--black">
            Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability
            and light weight are requisite. Sports cars are usually
            aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of
            gravity compared to standard models. Steering and suspension are
            typically designed for precise control at high speeds. Traditionally
            sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coupés also started to
            become popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a
            sports car and a grand tourer is not absolute.

            Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.
          </p>

          <p class="article__content right__text--white">
            Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and
            early sporting regulations often demanded four seats (even
            three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats
            became common from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may also
            have small back seats that are often really only suitable for
            luggage or small children; such a configuration is referred to as a
            2+2 (two full seats + two "occasional" seats).
          </p>

          <p class="article__content right__text--white">
            Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to
            increase the practicality of their vehicles by increasing the
            seating room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the center
            of the car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on each side
            and slightly behind the driver. The arrangement was originally
            considered for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as impractical
            because of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle.
            McLaren used the design in their F1.
